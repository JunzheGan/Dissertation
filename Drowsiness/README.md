The live driver fatigue detection is demostrated in Final.IPYNB

The "my_model_3.h5" is the after-trained model for eyes and the "mouth_model" if the final model for mouth

The eye_model.IPYNB shows the step-by-step process of building the eye model

The mouth_model.IPYNB shows the step-by-step process of building the eye model

The three "haarcascade.xml" files are used to track face and eyes
